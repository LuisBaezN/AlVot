# AlVot

Many datasets include mixed data in them (cuantitative and cualtitative). Thus, a data transformation is needed to train models like support vectorial machines (SVM), artifitial neural networks (ANN) or k nearest networks (k-NN). 

In this repo a pattern combinatory logic technique is implemented in several databases through a votation algorithm (AlVot).

You can consult the results of the algorithm in the report(spanish) added to the repo.

## Datasets

The data used to test this algorithm comes from the University of California Irvine (UCI) repository. The datasets are:

- Heart Disease
- Zoo
- Insurance Company Benchmark (COIL 2000)
- Teaching Assistant Evaluation
- HCV data

# Attention

The full documentation and instructions to run this project will be available soon. You can consult the pdf file (spanish) to review the results of the algorithm.
