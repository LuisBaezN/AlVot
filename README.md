# AlVot

Many datasets include mixed data in them (cuantitative and cualtitative). Thus,  a data transformation is needed to train models like support vectorial machines (SVM), artifitial neural networks (ANN) or k nearest networks (k-NN). 

In this repo a pattern combinatory logic technique is implemented in several databases through a votation algorithm (AlVot).

## Datasets

The data used to test this algorithm comes from the University of California Irvine (UCI) repository. The datasets are:

- Heart Disease Data Set
- Zoo Data Set
- Insurance Company Benchmark (COIL 2000) Data Set
- Teaching Assistant Evaluation Data Set
- HCV data Data Set
